The downloading of the article is by the most combersome part of this process. "

News API indexes articles from over 30,000 worldwide sources (including main news sources such as ABC,BBC,CBS. CNN,Fox News etc. It also pulls blogs and online journals which are publicly available. Typically, NewsAPI is used to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    •What top stories is the NY Times running right now?\n",
    "    •What new articles were published about the next iPhone today?\n",
    "    •Has my company or product been mentioned or reviewed by any blogs recently?\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can search for articles with any combination of the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "    •Keyword or phrase. Eg: find all articles containing the word 'Microsoft'.\n",
    "    •Date published. Eg: find all articles published yesterday.\n",
    "    •Source name. Eg: find all articles by 'TechCrunch'.\n",
    "    •Source domain name. Eg: find all articles published on nytimes.com.\n",
    "    •Language. Eg: find all articles written in English.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    •Date published\n",
    "    •Relevancy to search keyword\n",
    "    •Popularity of source\n",
